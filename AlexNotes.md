# ScienceCard

A one-person project from Martin Fenner.

* [Launch announcement](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/09/28/announcing-sciencecard/)
* [Version 2 announcement](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/09/19/announcing-the-sciencecard-relaunch/)

The code was a fork of PLoS Article Level Metrics (ALM),
adding the facility for author-centric views on the data.
ScienceCard has now disappeared, but ALM is still being developed.
There is some explanation on the [ALM project website](http://articlemetrics.github.io/),
and the code for the latest incarnation, [Lagotto](https://github.com/mfenner/lagotto),
is on GitHub.

3D PDF images of a gigantic dinosaur ‘Dreadoughtus schrani’ which were deposited in figshare, and which was picked up by the media.  The various mentions in blogs, twitter, news outlets and other sources are tracked with Altmetric, which ranks the item in the top 5% of all items scored by Altmetric.

Glasgow alt metrics used with the pubs repository (but not the data ?) checking with Bill Nixon and research data team.

(probably not all of this….)

“It's very, very early for altmetrics to be used as major factors in decisions like tenure and granting. There is just still so much research to be done here. Remember that citation-based metrics have taken decades to establish their value in evaluation, and many still protest their use. 
That said, this altmetrics data is out there right now, and it's building pictures--fuzzy though they may be--of impact that are richer, broader, and more nuanced than anything we've ever seen before. Right now, today, altmetrics can mean the difference between a story and "data-supported story", and that's a pretty important difference.

Perhaps most importantly in the short term, growing awareness and use of altmetrics is driving conversations about impact--about what it is, what it could be, and what we should be rewarding. I think those conversation are long overdue, and I think we're going to increasingly see them bear fruit.”

"Often I become interested in papers which are not directly from my field through the sequences in NCBI database. So I really appreciate when authors submit also sequences from the non-target groups of their environmental studies."

David Richard Elliott from Manchester Metropolitan University (on the same thread)
"Another thing I am trying to do is publish detailed data and reproducible analyses as supplementary / on figshare / on GitHub etc., linking back to the paper. If someone finds and uses my methods/code maybe they will cite the paper. Too early to say if this is effective (so far not!)”

""Nobody really knows exactly what it means," says Euan Adie, a founder of Altmetric, which offers new-metrics services to its clients—"but what we're scoring is attention, it's not quality. It's literally how much attention it's getting online." Altmetric, Adie says, is not a substitute for peer review. “At this stage it's more about collecting the data and seeing what's in there,” he says.”

Let us help you measure the impact of your research. http://ow.ly/C77o5
(this goes back to 2014 so not sure if we could get a screenshot and use as an image…)
the link is the library’s measuring impact guide pages - maybe a screenshot of that instead?
