# ScienceCard

A one-person project from Martin Fenner.

* [Launch announcement](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/09/28/announcing-sciencecard/)
* [Version 2 announcement](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/09/19/announcing-the-sciencecard-relaunch/)

The code was a fork of PLoS Article Level Metrics (ALM),
adding the facility for author-centric views on the data.
ScienceCard has now disappeared, but ALM is still being developed.
There is some explanation on the [ALM project website](http://articlemetrics.github.io/),
and the code for the latest incarnation, [Lagotto](https://github.com/mfenner/lagotto),
is on GitHub.
