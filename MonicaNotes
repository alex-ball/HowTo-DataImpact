Research assessment should take data sharing into account
Workshop finds that data sharing should be rewarded and universities and
funders have an important role to play in this process. Metrics are not
yet sufficiently developed as a measure to be used in assessment.

Data sharing should be considered normal research practice, in fact not
sharing should be considered malpractice. Research funders and universities
should support and encourage data sharing. There are a number of important
aspects to consider when making data count in research and evaluation
procedures. Metrics are a necessary tool in monitoring the sharing of
data sets. However, data metrics are at present not very well developed
and there is not yet enough experience in what these metrics actually mean.
It is important to implement the culture of sharing through codes of
conducts in the scientific communities.
 
These are some of the key findings from the workshop ‘Making Data Count –
research data availability and research assessment’ which took place 11 
and 12 April 2013 in Berlin. The event brought together researchers, research 
funders, publishers, infrastructure providers, policy makers and technical 
experts to discuss whether data sharing could be incorporated in research 
assessment. At the workshop the study ‘The Value of Research Data – Metrics 
for datasets from a cultural and technical point of view’ was presented 
and discussed.

At present there is insufficient experience with alternative metrics and 
therefore it is hard to judge their value. More experiments are needed in 
this regard. Alternative metrics are not (at present) considered suitable 
as a measure of scientific quality. Peer review (both before or after 
publication) still has an important role to play. However, alternative 
metrics can be useful in showing the broader attention paid to research 
data. The citation of datasets should become standard behaviour among researchers.
Funders should incorporate the sharing of research data sets more strongly 
when judging project proposals and should offer funds to make sharing possible. 
Institutions should provide training, support and awareness raising not only 
among junior but also senior researchers. Learned societies and research 
communities can encourage data sharing by establishing codes of conduct. 
And finally the underlying infrastructures (e.g. the use of  identifiers) 
must be in place and easy to use.

"Sharing this audio talk because it's awesome and how timely. An inaugral 
lecture by Roger Burrows at Goldsmiths on 'Living by numbers? Metrics, 
algorithms and the Sociology of Everyday life'.

He starts of by talking about social classes in space, geodemographics 
codifications, of course big data, using algorithms to classify, and finally 
on living by numbers in academia - academic metrics that are supposed to 
mimic market processes (quantified control).

Anyway, great talk."

Monica's comments: this researcher expresses some scepticism about metrics 
and the principle of measuring everything; using metrics to drive competition; 
people are being more intensely monitored and surveyed when metrics are introduced
Slide 28 - 'moment of metrics'
Slide 29 - mentions data items
Slide 33/34 mentions H-Index
most relevant part of talk starts at 20.34 talking about academic metrics.

       Impact metrics for repositories – December 12th, 11am (GMT)
 
In this free RSP webinar, Mark MacGillivray, PhD candidate at the University 
of Edinburgh and founder of the Cottage Labs, will present why repositories’ 
metrics are useful and which type of metrics can be collected. Mark will give 
a brief introduction on the technical developments on repositories’ metrics 
and will present some examples from his current work.
 
This webinar may be of interest to librarians and repository managers.

Webinar: Beyond Publish or Perish: Alternative Metrics for Scholarship
Date: November 14, 2012
Time: 1:00 - 2:30 p.m. (Eastern time)
Event Webpage:
http://www.niso.org/news/events/2012/nisowebinars/alternative_metrics/

ABOUT THE WEBINAR

Increasingly, many aspects of scholarly communication-particularly
publication, research data, and peer review-undergo scrutiny by researchers
and scholars. Many of these practitioners are engaging in a variety of ways
with Alternative Metrics (#altmetrics in the Twitterverse). Alternative
Metrics take many forms but often focus on efforts to move beyond
proprietary bibliometrics and traditional forms of peer referencing in
assessing the quality and scholarly impact of published work. Join NISO for
a webinar that will present several emerging aspects of Alternative Metrics.

TOPICS AND SPEAKERS

. Article-Level Metrics at PLOS - Martin Fenner, Technical Lead, PLOS
Article-Level Metrics project

. Total-Impact and Other Altmetrics Initiatives - Jason Priem, Ph.D.
Student, Co-Principal Investigator, Total Impact

Heather is currently at the University of British Columbia and has built 
a formidable following in the world of data metrics. Her research focuses 
on studying the patterns, prevalence and impact of data sharing and reuse 
behaviour of “small science” post-publication datasets. She is one of the 
founders of total-impact, a web application that reveals traditional and 
non-traditional impact metrics of scholarly articles, datasets, software, 
slides, and blog posts.
