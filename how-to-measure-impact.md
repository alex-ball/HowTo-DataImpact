> This guide will help you to measure the impact of research data, whether your own or that of your department/institution. It provides ... This guide should interest researchers and principal investigators working on data-led research and administrators working with research quality assessment submissions.

Why measure the impact of research data?
========================================

Explanation of what impact is, and why it is the *mot du jour* amongst policy makers.

For researchers in short term: getting credit for full range of research outputs. Link to REF 2020 (and any other research QA schemes internationally that do/might count datasets)? By monitoring usage, get to know which forms of data preparation and data publication work the best.

Longer term: increased acceptance of data as research output will drive up data sharing, improving the quality of science and opening up opportunities for more forms of research.


Impact measurement concepts
===========================

Relationship between the impact of resources and impact of researchers.

Reminder of how bibliometrics and scientometrics work for traditional publications. Citations, impact factor.

Microattribution, ?nanopublication. 

Introduction to measures of impact other than citations: page views, download rates, tweets and retweets, trackbacks (from blogs, etc.), tagging, social bookmarking.

Tips for raising research data impact
=====================================

(Need to search literature for evidence, examples and case studies.)

Provide citation/discovery metadata. Use of identifers.

Provide enough metadata for reuse. Reproducibility.

Open access.

Deposit in major repository. (Too early to discuss certified repositories?)

Highlighting resources using social media. Academia.edu, ResearchGate, Mendeley, etc.


Current issues and challenges
=============================

Immaturity of the area.

Relationship between alt metrics and traditional citation-based metrics: measuring different things.

Possibilities (or otherwise) for gaming the system. Ethical behaviour.

Wider acceptance of alt metrics.
