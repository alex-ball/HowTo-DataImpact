Why measure the impact of research data?
========================================

A key measure of the worth of research is the impact it has, both within the academic community and beyond. In recent years funding bodies have placed increasing emphasis on monitoring the potential and actual impact of the research projects they fund.

Since 1997, the NSF has judged the merit of research proposals on their intellectual merit and their broader impact [@nsb2011mrc]. In the UK, impact plans became part of the bidding process for all Research Councils in 2009, though in 2010 the purpose of the plans was clarified by reformulating them as Pathways to Impact [@hodgson.porter2010pti]. In this part of their proposals, researchers are asked to consider how they might maximise the academic, societal and economic impact of their research.

At the other end of the research lifecycle, the 2014 Research Excellence Framework in the UK will include impact as an explicit element alongside outputs and environment [@ref2011dar].

(Explanation of what impact is, and why it is the *mot du jour* amongst policy makers.)

For researchers in short term: getting credit for full range of research outputs. Link to REF 2020 (and any other research QA schemes internationally that do/might count datasets)? By monitoring usage, get to know which forms of data preparation and data publication work the best.

Longer term: increased acceptance of data as research output will drive up data sharing, improving the quality of science and opening up opportunities for more forms of research.


Impact measurement concepts
===========================

Relationship between the impact of resources and impact of researchers.

Reminder of how bibliometrics and scientometrics work for traditional publications. Citations, impact factor.

Microattribution, ?nanopublication. 

Introduction to measures of impact other than citations: page views, download rates, tweets and retweets, trackbacks (from blogs, etc.), tagging, social bookmarking.

Thomson Reuters Data Citation Index
------------------------------------

In October 2012, Thomson Reuters launched the Data Citation Index (DCI) as part of its Web of Knowledge service [@herther2012trt]. It provides records at four levels of granularity: nanopublication, dataset, data study (a research activity producing one or more data sets) and repository. The records can be searched and filtered in various ways, in the same way as (and indeed in combination with) the other indices in Web of Knowledge. The records are linked so that, for example, from a repository record one can view records for the data studies and data sets held by that repository. Sample citations are also provided.

On each record, the DCI displays the number of times the entity has been cited in Web of Knowledge. Recognising the variety of ways in which data sets and repositories can be cited, the DCI counts not only entires in the reference list but also less formal citations that occur elsewhere in scholarly papers (for example, in the abstract or acknowledgements).

Selection for inclusion in the DCI is at the level of whole repositories rather than individual data sets or studies. The criteria used for selecting repositories include longevity, sustainability, activity (in terms of new data being deposited), metadata held for the data (ideally in English, with links to associated literature, funding information, and so on), and quality assurance procedures [@tr2012res].

Tips for raising research data impact
=====================================

(Need to search literature for evidence, examples and case studies.)

Provide citation/discovery metadata. Use of identifers.

Provide enough metadata for reuse. Reproducibility.

Open access.

Deposit in major repository. (Too early to discuss certified repositories?)

Highlighting resources using social media. Academia.edu, ResearchGate, Mendeley, etc.


Current issues and challenges
=============================

Immaturity of the area.

Relationship between alt metrics and traditional citation-based metrics: measuring different things.

Possibilities (or otherwise) for gaming the system. Ethical behaviour.

Wider acceptance of alt metrics.
(acceptance by whom? Funders? Institutions? Academics?)


At least *some* academics have reservations about the culture of metrics and the use of measures
to enforce competition. Audits, monitoring and data collection are considered to be a force that shapes academia, 
in a manner that is too dominating.  Scepticism is expressed that value can be captured through metrics, particularly for research outputs. 
The influence of metrics on decision-making e.g. choosing to publish in a journal with a high impact factor, is questioned. 
In this light, the inclusion of data metrics is seen as an example of the increasing obsession with measurement, 
and is not necessarily viewed as a positive development [@burrows2013lwn].
